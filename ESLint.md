## Adding ESLint to VSC

## Adding ESLint to pre-commit hooks

### After initializing git:
- 1 - Go to .git/hooks and rename pre-commit.sample to pre-commit as instructed.
- 2 - Change existing code to become only the code found in the [link](https://gist.github.com/rashtay/328da46a99a9d7c746636df1cf769675
).
- 3 - finally make sure your file is executable, if it isn't change the execute(x) permission.
